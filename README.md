# Clippy

[Clippy](https://felixrieseberg.github.io/clippy/) let's you run a variety of large language models (LLMs) locally on your computer while sticking with a user interface of the 1990s. Through Llama.cpp, it supports models in the popular GGUF format, which is to say most publicly available models. It comes with one-click installation support for Google's Gemma3, Meta's Llama 3.2, Microsoft's Phi-4, and Qwen's Qwen3.

It's a love letter and homage to the late, great Clippy, the assistant from Microsoft Office 1997. The character was designed by illustrator Kevan Atteberry, who created more than 15 potential characters for Microsoft's Office Assistants. This app is not affiliated, approved, or supported by Microsoft. Consider it software art. If you don't like it, consider it software satire.

It is also meant to be a reference implementation of [@electron/llm](https://github.com/electron/llm), hoping to help other developers of Electron apps make use of local language models.
